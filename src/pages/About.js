              We are a family business that was created in april 2019. Initially
              we started with the idea of making bags fleeing a bit from the
              traditional creating exclusive pieces of art by handmade using
              mixes of textures and materials such as leather, thread, fabric
              and beads.

              Everything is done with the techniques of sewing, embroidery and
              crochet. Our goal is to bring joy and positivity through each
              piece because we put a lot of passion in what we do.
